    <p className='about-me'> Hi, my name is Jacky Pan and I’m a Bay Area Native. I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in front-end design, web development, and back-end data management. I recently graduated from Hack Reactor Software Engineering Bootcamp and University of California Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Biological Sciences! I am an advocate for incessant growth within an idea, oneself, a team, and society. The goals I aim to achieve in my career include creating an extraordinary experience for a company’s technical audience and providing high-quality engineering to meet client needs. My professional experience includes website development, nonprofit, and project management.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Outside of work, you can find me embarking on food adventures, cooking, cheering on the Warriors, playing volleyball, and dancing to good music.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am currently seeking a full-time opportunity in the Bay Area and would also love to gain more insight into your advice or ideas. Please feel free to reach out and connect, I look forward to speaking with you!  </p>
